title: #1 The start of my journey v1.1
---

This is the first post to my website. The journey so far has been an interesting experience
for building this website. Many problems occurred. In the beginning, I decided that it was 
finally time for me to build a website. So, I created an html page and didn\'t really know 
where to go from there. So, I looked online for some sample portfolios and found a couple 
extremely basic ones, which I began to copy in terms of formatting.

Halfway through, I realized that I was copying an extraordinarily large amount of headers word for word because I needed the 
same head. So, I thought that there must\'ve been a simpler way to do this, and thus my trek for
a templating language began.

From there, I found Jekyll, which was created to work well with Github
Pages, so I decided to try it! So far, Jekyll has been pretty good, as it is essentially exactly what
I desired from a templating engine. It allows me to include html files such that I can create part of
any html file in my includes folder and include it within my html with a simple piece of code.

From there, I scrapped my entire project to build everything based off of Jekyll, but my project\'s 
user interface still looked like it came from a garbage can, so I looked for more themes. This is one
of the best themes that I\'ve found as it\'s simple and easy to navigate. The theme I am currently using is
called Hyde. While it isn\'t an exact copy, as I\'ve customized it to what my limited aesthetic ability can create,
