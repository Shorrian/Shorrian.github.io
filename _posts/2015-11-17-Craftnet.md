<p>Craftnet is a place that lets artistic entrepreneurs sell their personal arts and crafts. </p>

<p>This project was created during my senior year in high school, and it was my first introduction to web development. I created this website along with two other friends and we all learned much from this project. Not only was this my first introduction to web development, but this was also my first attempt at using a scripting language, Python. This very website is where I began my fundamental knowledge of using Python and expanding my knowledge base of other programming languages.</p>
