    I am a freshman studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
    I've created this blog as a place to keep track of each of my future projects,
    and possible past and current ones as well. These projects are, by all means, 
    welcome to comments so whoever sees this blog, I do hope you will at least
    send me a message as to what I could improve upon for my project styles. My main interest 
    is currently in artificial intelligence, however, am also still in the phase of exploring
    all that computer science has to offer.
