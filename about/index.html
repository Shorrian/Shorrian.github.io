    <h2 class="header-line">About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a freshman currently studying at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. So far, I have explored a multitude of realms of computer science such as web development, desktop application development, game development and mobile application development.</p>
    
    <p> Initially, my main interest was game development, since games were what introduced me to the world of programming. However, after trying it out a couple of times, I realized that I have much to improve upon before I could implement all the features of what I desired to create. So, in order to pursue such an interest in the future, I have decided to look through other aspects of computer science and what they have to offer.</p>

    <p>As of right now, my current interests lie in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as I know that I have much to explore in those fields. I have been creating many self-projects and seeking other projects in hopes of learning more about each of the fields that are offered in computer science, and I have progressed much, but I have only explored the tip of the iceberg.  I am continuing this journey of seeking more about what I could learn from computer science before finally implementing my goal.</p>

    <p>I am often entertained by the new advances in technology, and one that I am especially watching is Augmented Reality. It has always been a childhood dream of mine to be able to create and play in a virtual world.</p>
