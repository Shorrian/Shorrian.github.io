            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
            Hi! My name is Harrison Ding and this is my portfolio website and blog on my past, current, and upcoming projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first language that I learned was English... or maybe Chinese. I'm not entirely sure actually, but one of those two considering they're the only two languages I know... 
            </p>
            <p>
                Seriously though, my first language was Java, but recently I've decided to learn more languages and put them in my arsenal of coding languages. The main one I've been learning recently is Python, because it seems easy enough to use and at the same time so seemingly useful for instantaneous results. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each year since the beginning of high school, I've tried many different projects ranging from desktop applications to mobile applications to websites.
                Through these projects, I've learned many languages (e.g. Java, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, C++, C#) and frameworks (e.g. Django, Unity, Libgdx, Bootstrap, Android Dev)
            </p>
            <p>
                To be honest, many times I've failed in creating a portfolio/blog, so let's hope that this is the attempt that will succeed. :D
            </p>
            <p>
            Thanks for reading!
